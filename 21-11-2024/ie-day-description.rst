Abstract
--------

Production and consumption systems are socio-technical systems that are now more complex and intertwined than ever. Studying the sustainability of such systems can be challenging since aspects like heterogeneous patterns, non-linear dynamics and emergent behaviours of consumers and stakeholders add another layer of complexity.

The application of complexity-oriented methods, such as Agent-Based Models (ABMs), can address many of these aspects; however, these methodologies are far from being mainstream in the discipline of industrial ecology due to multiple challenges, including model linkages, analytical frameworks, and data limitations.

In this session, we will briefly introduce this approach to those who want to learn more about the ABM paradigm by showcasing three case studies that contribute to assessing the sustainability impacts of socio-technical systems. The presented models, techniques, and learned lessons will spark the discussion regarding opportunities for further applications/extension and the challenges of adopting such methodologies to address current research inquiries.

Overall, the aim of the session is to reflect on how to mainstream methods and best practices across the discipline of Industrial Ecology, with an interest in adopting complexity-oriented approaches. Such a session will provide a virtual space to engage with fellow modellers and further discuss methods and applications to study sustainable practices.
